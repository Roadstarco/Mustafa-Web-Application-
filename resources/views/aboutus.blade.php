								<p><strong style="font-size:23px;">What is Road Star?</strong></p>
								<p>The advent of online service platforms and mobile smartphone applications has led to an increase in fast delivery tasks like somehow achieving the speed of light in real time.</p>

								<p>In this case, shippers send requests on the Roadstar App and drivers accept the request to make delivery along their usual route. 
								Another example would be a driver who can easily pick up parcels from a retail store, a warehouse or any dedicated pickup location, and deliver them to customer locations on their way home or on their way to work, without altering their normal route. This means that our application also provides Route Efficiency.</p>

								<p>We do not only focus on shipping, but we also offer delivery services to international routes, not only by road, but also by flights and ocean delivery services, through our Roadstar groundbreaking Crowd shipping platform.</p>

								<p>The platform is unique because it allows everyone to unleash the power of crowd participation in local and international package delivery. By doing so it offers multiple opportunities to platform users by increasing efficiency, saving costs, and retaining revenue for businesses.</p>

								<p>Simply put this package delivery on steroids!</p>

								<p>At its core, the crowdsourced delivery resolves the pickup and delivery problem, that aims to transport goods from origins to destinations at minimum costs.</p>
