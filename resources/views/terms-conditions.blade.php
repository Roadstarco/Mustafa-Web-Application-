<p><strong>Terms and Condition Agreement</strong></p>

<p>Effective: Jan 1st, 2020</p>

<p>READ THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS (<strong>&ldquo;AGREEMENT&rdquo;</strong>) CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ROADSTAR CORPORATION, A GEORGIA CORPORATION (<strong>&ldquo;ROADSTAR,&rdquo; &ldquo;WE,&rdquo; &ldquo;US,&rdquo; OR &ldquo;OUR&rdquo;</strong>).</p>

<p>RoadStar is a crowdsourced delivery application.\ Leveraging network of existing community members, local drivers, shippers, customers, platform users, delivery providers, truck drivers, freight forwarders, professional drivers and courier service providers to deliver packages to customers&#39; doors in the fastest, most cost saving approach possible. This is a first of its kind in package delivery, and in the process leaving the customer satisfied. Our goal is to cause local packages delivery to occur on less than an hourly basis within a 50-mile radius. This efficient Route platform allows the customer&nbsp;to track, in real time, his or her order&nbsp;via GPS or SMS alerts on their Smartphone. The system of repeatedly checking status update by tracking packages with a tracking number, which is&nbsp;the case with On Demand and&nbsp;Last Mile Delivery Service Providers,&nbsp;popular among most large courier services, will soon be a thing of the past. This innovation was inspired by the huge potential that still exists in the Gig economy. So, in order to penetrate the gigantic e-commerce market, young digital-first, digital-heavy customer base, we created a customer first, &quot;on the hour delivery&quot;, platform.</p>

<p>To become part of the RoadStar &ldquo;Community&rdquo;, as a User, Shipper, Delivery Provider or the Driver who performs Delivery Services in the &ldquo;Community&rdquo;, you expressly agree to be bound by the terms, future amendments, changes, updates or additions to this Terms and Condition Agreement. These future changes or updates will be available on the App and on our website at <a href="http://www.myroadstar.org">www.myroadstar.org</a>. These changes will be emailed to all members of our community as any update to our existing Terms and Conditions are made to all registered email addresses. Once you download our App and are approved after the application process to become a driver or a user in the community, you agree to make it your responsibility to abide by RoadStar Terms and Conditions Agreement in its entirety.</p>

<p>THIS PROVISION WILL ALLOW US TO EMPLOY THE USE OF ARBITRATION INDIVIDUALLY, NOT BY GROUP ACTION, TO RESOLVE DISPUTES OR CONFLICTS, NOT CLASS ACTIONS.</p>

<p>LITIGATION OR JOINT LEGAL ACTION BY GROUP OF PEOPLE WILL LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE, CONFLICTS OR DISAGREEMENTS.</p>

<p>FURTHERMORE, BEWARE THAT, THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT COULD AFFECT YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN PENDING PROPOSED CLASS ACTION LITIGATION.</p>

<p><strong>Acceptance of this Agreement</strong></p>

<p>At RoadStar we provide the most up to date technology tools, real time, no lag, optimal instant delivery services, schedule option delivery services, Below the Hour Delivery, concrete security, secure payment processing system, geolocation tools, route optimization, move-on-demand scheduling tools, intelligent on route tracking and quick access, allowing customers and community members to connect with Drivers (local delivery services) or User to User. RoadStar platform has two types of relationship User (Shipper) to Driver (Delivery Professional) and User (Shipper) to User (Delivery Provider).</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Driver and User Delivery Service is when a User in the RoadStar Community posts a &ldquo;Pickup Request&rdquo;, &ldquo;Load&rdquo;, &ldquo;package&rdquo;, &ldquo;parcel&rdquo;, &ldquo;cargo&rdquo; or &ldquo;freight&rdquo; on RoadStar Dashboard for pickup and delivery by a Driver or Provider. That which has been described is called a &ldquo;Route&rdquo; on the RoadStar Platform. Any Driver within the community who successfully connects with the User or Shipper gets that &ldquo;Route&rdquo;.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>The second service we provide is the User to User &ldquo;Requests&rdquo; designated for international delivery, maritime service or local delivery. The User or Shipper posts a &ldquo;Pickup Request&rdquo; on the RoadStar platform and can be seen by everyone on the platform. Once an item becomes available on the RoadStar Dashboard, other Users begin to send offers, with bid amounts to the Requester. The User who becomes successful with their offer, within the community, gets the Route and proceeds to pick up the item from the Shipper to complete the delivery. That User becomes a Delivery Provider. At any time, a Community member or User can become a Delivery Provider. The Delivery Provider is simply a person who is traveling in the same direction of parcel drop-offs, and volunteers to pick up an item from other Community members for a fee. Another way a Community member (aka User) may become a Delivery Provider is that if a Community member has availability to accept a load or package, and makes that availability known to other Community members by posting it on the RoadStar App Dashboard, the owner of that container, be it delivery by ocean vessel, by car or by flight, becomes a Delivery Provider.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>RoadStar App makes it possible to connect individuals and businesses (&ldquo;Users and Shippers &ldquo;) with Drivers and Delivery Providers seeking to perform the Delivery Services. The job of pickup and delivery is known as the &ldquo;Route&rdquo;. Drivers, Delivery Professionals, Delivery Providers and Shippers are referred to as &ldquo;Community Members &ldquo;.</p>

<p>Drivers who participate in RoadStar platform are self-employed independent contractors who voluntarily download the RoadStar App in order to carry out Delivery Services to perform route delivery services for users. Drivers who sign up to connect to users on RoadStar App can be Drivers on other platforms if they choose to.</p>

<p><strong>Delivery of Alcohol and Tobacco</strong></p>

<p>A Driver must be 21 years of age&nbsp;to undertake any Routes containing tobacco and alcoholic products.</p>

<p>A Driver on Route for the delivery of tobacco and alcoholic beverages must request a valid, government-issued identification to confirm that the receiver is 21 years of age at the minimum. Examples of valid, government-issued IDs are Driver&rsquo;s licenses, Passports, U.S. military IDs and Permanent Resident Cards.</p>

<p>When delivering an item involving all alcoholic beverages, a Driver must be vigilant to establish that the receiver is not conspicuously drunk or intoxicated before delivering the Items.&nbsp;Most States in the United States have laws prohibiting the delivery of alcoholic beverages to anyone who is visibly intoxicated. A Driver, on RoadStar platform, is strongly advised to pay extra attention to this in order not to become personally liable for breaking the Law.</p>

<p><strong>Signs of Intoxication commonly referred to as drunkenness.</strong></p>

<p>Serving alcohol to a visibly intoxicated person is against the law. If you can<br />
tell on sight that a person has been drinking or using other drugs, the person is<br />
visibly intoxicated.</p>

<p>If a person shows a combination of several signs that could be a strong indication that the person is intoxicated. Remember that intoxication can result from the use of drugs other than alcohol.</p>
